# Foundation
This code has been created by Zabbix (https://www.zabbix.com/integrations/discord) and adjusted by Riley Nevins (https://github.com/rileyjnevins/discord-zabbix-alert) to support the Discord API & Zabbix changes in version 5.0 and newer.

I have modified this script for `@mentioning` users with their Discord ID saved in their Zabbix profiles.
I do not take/claim ownership of the contents found here.
